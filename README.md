# WebScrapping-and-Text-Summarization

Text summarization is a subdomain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of texts. In this Jupyter Notebook, I had implemented a simple NLP-based technique for text summarization. I had used Python's NLTK library for summarizing Wikipedia articles.

Steps Involved are:
1. Preprocessing
2. Converting Text To Sentences
3. Find Weighted Frequency of Occurrence.
4. Calculating Sentence Scores and Getting the Summary
